I am an Infrastructure software engineer. Currently, I am a founding engineer
at  [Zerostack](http://www.zerostack.com), developing highly available
distributed systems. I have led the design and development of core components
of the Zerostack Cloud platform, including  a distributed
self-healing control plane; and a virtual machine high-availability feature.
The following blog posts give a high-level overview of some of this work.

* [VM High Availability](https://www.zerostack.com/virtual-machine-high-availability/)
* [Building a highly available private cloud](https://www.zerostack.com/building-a-highly-available-private-cloud/)
 
Prior to that I was an early engineer at [VMware](http://www.vmware.com)
with contributions across the software stack, from resource management in 
operating systems to distributed storage systems and distributed systems
orchestration.

I got a Master's from [Purdue University](http://www.cs.purdue.edu), and
a Bachelor's from  the
[Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in),
both in Computer Science.
