I am an Infrastructure software engineer at  [Zerostack](http://www.zerostack.com) building
highly available distributed systems. Here is the kind of work I am doing here:

* [Building a highly available private cloud](https://www.zerostack.com/building-a-highly-available-private-cloud/)
 
Prior to that I was an early engineer at [VMware](http://www.vmware.com)
with contributions across the software stack, from operating systems to distributed storage systems,
to distributed systems orchestration.

I got a Master's from [Purdue University](http://www.cs.purdue.edu), and Bachelor's from 
[Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in), both in Computer Science.
