I am an Infrastructure software engineer at  [Zerostack](http://www.zerostack.com) building
highly available distributed systems. Before that I was an engineer at [VMware](http://www.vmware.com)
with contributions across the software stack, from operating systems to distributed storage and
orchestration.
